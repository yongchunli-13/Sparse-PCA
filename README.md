# Exact and Approximation Algorithms for Sparse PCA

This project contains the implementations of exact algorithms, approximation algorithms, and continuous relaxations for Sparse PCA (SPCA). 

## Exact algorithms
Further, we compute a lower bound and an upper bound of SPCA using the local search algorithm and subgradient method, which are used as input values in MILP. The test data is in "pitdata.csv" giving a matrix of size 13 * 13. More datasets can be found in "datasets.zip".

For our paper "Exact and Approximation Algorithms for Sparse PCA", and detailed implementation of the algorithms and formulations, see: http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2020/05/7802.pdf.
